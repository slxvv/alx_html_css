# SmileSchool CSS Advanced Project

## Overview
This project is part of the ALX HTML/CSS curriculum. It builds on the HTML structure created in the HTML Advanced project by adding CSS styling to match the provided Figma design for the SmileSchool website, a platform for learning smiling techniques.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement CSS styling for a webpage.
- Use CSS selectors, specificity, and box properties effectively.
- Ensure the webpage is W3C compliant and visually matches the Figma design.

## Repository Structure
- **GitHub Repository**: alx_html_css
- **Directory**: css_advanced
- **Files**:
  - `README.md`: Project documentation.
  - `index.html`: HTML structure for the SmileSchool website.
  - `styles.css`: CSS styles to match the Figma design.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Ensure fonts `Source Sans Pro` (via Google Fonts) and `Spin Cycle OT` (fallback to sans-serif) are available.
3. Replace placeholder image paths in `index.html` with provided assets from the project resources.
4. Link `styles.css` in `index.html` using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`.

## Tasks
1. **Import the Style**: Created and linked `styles.css`.
2. **Header and Banner**: Styled the header and hero section per Figma.
3. **Quotes**: Styled the testimonial section with a two-column layout.
4. **Videos List**: Styled the tutorials section with a responsive grid.
5. **Membership**: Styled the membership benefits section with a grid and button.
6. **FAQ**: Styled the FAQ section with a two-column layout.
7. **Footer**: Styled the footer with logo, social icons, and copyright.

## Notes
- All styling is done using pure CSS without external libraries (except Font Awesome for icons, as provided in the HTML).
- The code is W3C compliant; validate using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- Images should be sourced from the provided resources (replace placeholders like `images/logo.png`).
- Fonts: `Source Sans Pro` is included via Google Fonts; `Spin Cycle OT` uses a fallback due to unavailability.
- The project must be completed by **June 16, 2025, 12:00 AM**.
- Request a manual QA review upon completion via the project submission platform.
